- **Configuration Slots**: Save up to 10 different configurations
- **Real-time Adjustment**: Modify settings while the application is running

### Mode Presets
- **LIGHT**: Gentle recoil control (Vertical: 3, Horizontal: 1, Delay: 0.02s)
- **MEDIUM**: Balanced recoil control (Vertical: 6, Horizontal: 2, Delay: 0.015s)
- **HEAVY**: Strong recoil control (Vertical: 8, Horizontal: 2, Delay: 0.01s)

## Controls

### Application Controls
- **START/STOP**: Toggle the recoil and rapid fire systems
- **LOAD CONFIG**: Load saved configuration from selected slot
- **SAVE CONFIG**: Save current settings to selected slot
- **EXIT**: Close the application

### In-Game Controls

- Can be manually edited for advanced customization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Application not responding**: Ensure you're running as administrator
2. **Input not detected**: Check if your game allows external input
3. **Performance issues**: Reduce delay values or disable unused features

### Performance Tips
- Use **LIGHT** mode for better performance
- Disable **rapid fire** if not needed
- Increase **delay** values for smoother operation
